  <h1 class = "#">How many kidneys does Owen Gates have?</h1>
  <p>
    According to anonymous sources, Owen Gates currently owns 3 kidneys. This count is up to date, and was last checked 4 minutes ago. According to our sources, we believe that Owen Gates is looking to aquire another kidney by August 28, 2023, but we cannot say for certain. It is believed that Owen Gates has considered selling one of his 3 kidneys for $300,000, but there is no way to say for certain. Currently, Owen Gates is wanted for arrest for Grand Larceny in the first degree and Money Laundering in the first degree, but, as far as we know, he is still at large. It has been speculated that he wishes to sell his kidney to pay his bail.

  <h2 class = "#">What about gallbladders?</h2>
  <p>
    Although we do not have an up-to-date count for Owen Gate's gallbladders, last time we checked, it appeared as if Owen Gates had 1 gallbladder. This is the normal amount of gallbladders for humans, which might be hard to believe coming from Owen Gates, but it is the only number that we have evidence of being true.
